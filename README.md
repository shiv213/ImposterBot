## Key Features
#### Components
* Discord Bot (ImposterBot)
    - Streamlines managing game lobbies and inviting friends via Discord
    - Mutes all players during the game, unmutes them during voting 


* Game Listener Executable (ImposterBot Among Us Game Listener)
    - While you play Among Us, the Game Listener Executable will read Among Us game data and push it to the database   

## How To Use
Only one person in the game/voice channel needs to do the following:
- Run the `.server` command on your Discord server to get your server id (this is unique per Discord server)
- Launch the Among Us game (this needs to be open for the next step to work)
- Run the `ImposterBot Among Us Game Listener.exe` (instructions on where to find this below)
- Input your server id and press `Start`
- Get into a game of Among Us, and run the `.start` command in your Discord server once the game starts
    - Note: for the time being, everyone will be muted in the lobbies (this will be changed shortly)
- Once you're done with your game, run the `.stop` command in your Discord server
